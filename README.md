# What is the problem?
Browsing a bookstore requires querying information about available books including: titles, authors, categories, the number of pages, and publisher.

# What is the something extra?
The program can suggest recommendations based on multiple pieces of information provided (e.g. "What books are similar to <Book title>"), and can combine information (e.g. "What science-fiction book is by <Author>") for querying about the bookstore's product

# What did we learn from doing this?
(This should be written after you have done the work.) What is the bottom-line? Is logic programming suitable for (part-of) the task? Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
