* for the 'adj' more_than, less_than variants should we check the the '_,pages/dollars' that the '_' is actually a number? 
    - So would add something like: [number(_),pages | T] instead of just [_,pages | T] to prevent users from inputing cat or something and have it pass?

* conjunction 'and': <adj> ..and.. <adj> ?or something like this

* 'has more/less than ...'

* 'price of ...'

* 'length of ...'

* 'how,much,does,the,wonder,cost'

* 'how,much,is,the,wonder'

* '...category of...<category>...'

* 'is <book> more/less than...'

* think of a way to represent author so that Prolog does not check only one element; e.g. author(emma) fails
--> reason why ask([what,is,a,book,by,emma,donoghue],R). fails

* need to include the empty list as the rest of the difference list and let Prolog know that empty list is the end
--> reason why ask([what,is,a,book,published,by,harperCollins],R). fails
